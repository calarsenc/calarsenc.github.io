Open source software, and most software in general, relies on the ability to copy code and run it again elsewhere. When people run the same library on another machine, no one cares that it is not “the original” code, only that it operates in the same way. Why should this not be the same for transferring the human mind and its workings? </p>

The ability to transcribe and move thoughts from medium to medium does nothing to diminish its salience when we read others thoughts, so why not the operation of our own? The transfer of thoughts to more endurable vessels than our brains like stone, bone, parchment, and electronic databases has given veritable superpowers to our species. Why not operate the seat of thought itself on a more endurable, faster, more efficient substrate than the electrochemical machine our headcase currently rests with.

 The worry about uploading is intense, we often remark that technology is not bad in and of itself - only its use can be morally judged, yet our future with abundant technology is too frequently depicted as dystopian. Frederick Jameson explained this phenomenon with “The Hysterical Sublime” which is a cultural zeitgeist where technology replaces nature as the main external object of human awe (Sublimity).

Instead of viewing uploading as hard science fiction to fear, it is time to turn it into a mission oriented goal we can start working on in earnest. To do so we need to discard the notion of the continuity problem, which is the main mental blocker towards seriously considering changing vessels from our biological suits to a different substrate for the people that know about WBE, and are high agency. It is important that we do so now, as there is a severe lack of multidisciplinary research on the technology needed to bring about a full upload. WBE should stop being feared by the contingent of rationalists who worry about it, because it has important applications to AI safety, and AI-Human co-existence. So please, let us stop worrying about the continuity problem. 

“The Continuity Problem” is the conception that uploading yourself will never be yourself. I refer to this article to explain why this is probably not true, for it is brilliant, and I admire Keith Wiley for going into such brilliant depth: 
https://carboncopies.org/Resources/Writing/2023_NondestructuveMU/Post/#the-conjecture

The problem of creating some kind of p-zombie, or truly another person by accident, are different problems, and should be taken seriously by anyone who wants to expedite WBE. 

To go into some detail on why the continuity “problem” is viewed as a capital P problem, this can be simplified into:

#1 poor communication and poor description of a true upload (causing people to worry prematurely about their qualia, thinking that we have jumped right into the core of the “Hard” problem of consciousness).

#2 essentialism (draining into mind-body dualism, the counterpart to physicalism and the emergent evolutionist paradigm).

#3 the theory of panpsychism.

Let's start with essentialism and panpsychism. 

Essentialism is the view that objects have a set of attributes that are necessary to their identity. You can think of Plato's idealism which held that all things have such an "essence"—an "idea" or "form" - Essentialism is continuing to believe this - that all things have certain attributes that are absolutely necessary for them to be what they are. Essentialism is a conceptual lens rather than a material fact - we learned that essentialism is a conceptual lens by seeing the world and our conceptions shift over time, and from understanding how complex and interlinked things are when we try to understand things in present time.

The difficulty humans have in relinquishing essentialism can also be seen when people discuss what a “woman”, a “state”, or a “religion” is instead of asking what they can be in order to achieve a certain outcome. Most if not all wrangling about language, is performed to achieve an agenda, whether conscious or not. To operate, to steer, you need to have a clear view of your axioms, and a desire to fully understand how something works in relation to something else. Such thinking is superior in terms of understanding things when compared to essentialism, which is a fundamentally stagnant conceptual lens mostly employed in naturalist arguments today. The essentialism in the continuity problem is not really naturalist, but is one of human exceptionalism, the belief that the subjective operation of our minds is so special that it cannot possibly be mechanistic, even at the quantum level. This is hubris, it is also counterintuitively limiting the extent of human exceptionalism to three pounds of flesh. 

The reason why we are able to disband Essentialism is because we are beginning to understand complex systems better, in a more cybernetically minded way, rather than through an essentialist lens. In this discursion we are focusing on the very complex system of the brain. From my previous article on cybernetic thinking in the modern age:

“Cybernetic theory invented a new set of concepts that allowed a rejection and replacement of ontological perspectives for an operational approach that replaced the old ontological perspectives. The shift towards an operation epistemology is explained best through the famous cybernetician W. Ross Ashby’s statement that Cybernetics:

 “does not ask “what is this thing?” but “what does it do?”.
””””
Because things are complex, we cannot ask as readily what it “is”, modern humans have to ask how “it” connects to and operates with all the other things - that is what that thing “is”. Things are what they do, and in our case  when it comes to our soul, our mind - our nervous system), feel…. 

Obviously, this is quite the Functionalist viewpoint, standing in opposition to panpsychism, functionalism is a philosophical theory. According to functionalism, mental states are defined by their causal roles or functional relationships within a system, rather than by their intrinsic properties or physical composition. In other words, what makes something a mental state is not what it is made of, but what function it has within the system, following a line of cybernetic thought - not the thought of intrinsic consciousness, which is what panpsychism is. Those who support a substrate independent humanity are frequently consciously functionalists, but they need not be at all. 

 Meanwhile, In the context of cognition, computation is used to describe the workings of the mind or brain, in the predominant theory of mind it is implied that cognitive processes can be understood in terms of information processing, another word for which is computation: the processing of information to a set of rules or algorithms. Computational Functionalism is just the combination of the two terms, and describes the best opponent to panpsychism in terms of mainstream theories of the mind. 

Computational Functionalism seeks to answer the problem proposed by Leibniz's gap or Chalmers “Hard Problem” of consciousness (why can we feel what it feels like to feel) through functional analysis of the brain and its processes. A few months ago Nature published a paper revealing a neural population code in the IFG (Inferior frontal gyrus) for embedding the contextual structure of natural language. This neural code could be geometrically mapped to GPT-2, ergo neural code similar to what we are used to seeing in machines - because we are a congregation of molecular machines. The paper exposed a vector-based neural code for natural language processing in the human brain for the first time, as CTC has claimed for decades.

Panpsychism is the term to describe the belief that it is not computation, but consciousness itself, which is at the core of all matter. To explain how that is not a testable hypothesis it is useful to mention its opponent: Pancomputationalism, which conversely claims that computation is fundamental in all matter, putting aside what one intuitively believes may be true with present knowledge, it remains true that that at the lowest level of physical nature: what computation is or psychism is remains a purely philosophical exercise at present. We do not understand the ultimate limits of physics, so we cannot claim pancomputationalism nor panpsychism, but we have begun to understand what consciousness is through a computational functionalist way of examining it, and we can reject panpsychism as an equally useful theory in this regard for now. Panpsychism invents a new characteristic of fundamental reality and is a solution looking for a problem to justify its existence, that problem is the hard problem of consciousness. 

It is worth noting just how much the computational theory of mind has been bolstered by our understanding of the brain and the ​​evolutionary emergentist paradigm. We have started to understand a lot more than we did about the input that forms our experiences through understanding the specialized receptors and sensory organs that transduce external stimuli into signals the brain can interpret: forming our internal experiences or qualia. 

We already know a lot about how our brains get input, Mechanoreceptors in the ear convert air vibrations into sound. Sight comes from photoreceptors in the eye detecting light, allowing us to see. Touch from mechanoreceptors in the skin and mucosa, enabling us to feel texture, pressure, and movement. Smell and taste rely on chemoreceptors in the nose and tongue to identify chemical compositions. Proprioceptors in muscles and joints provide awareness of body position and movement. Mechanoreceptors in the vestibular system also aid our Equilibrioception - balance and spatial orientation. Thermoreceptors in the skin and hypothalamus detect temperature changes. Nociceptors (open ended afferent nerve fiber) detect pain, and give us the physical experience of it. Internal chemical conditions, such as O2, CO2, salt, and glucose levels, are monitored by chemoreceptors in various organs and are critical for metabolic regulation. Chronoception, the sense of time, and other senses like baroreception and osmoreception, also play roles in internal and external environmental sensing.

Meanwhile, Consciousness itself seems to be primarily emerging from a collection of action potentials triggered by external stimuli through senses like the above, and the triggering of action potentials by themselves (internal though) - as we are one big feedback loop. The Action potentials themselves are primarily the domain of neurons. The cell body of a neuron is surrounded by tentacle-like appendages: Dendrites who bring information to the cell body and an axon that shoots it out. The small space between an axon and a dendrite is the synapse. On average each axon is connected to one thousand synapses of other neurons. Axons release neurotransmitters that stimulate these nearby dendrites to undergo action potentials themselves. This makes it easy for action potentials to go from neuron to neuron, traveling great distances throughout the body in a short time (but you can still travel around the world several times as a computing packet in that time), and triggering at the same time, in different places, continuously, thoughts move like the sea, in waves. 

This fluid collection of ever firing neurons gives us a feeling of beautiful continuous reality when we are not in deep sleep, knocked out, or otherwise incapacitated. 

Place yourself in the future. Someone has devised a way to copy you, duplicating your entire self perfectly, or running a high bandwidth emulation of you, that would be indistinguishable to you running with your real meaty organs.

Let's imagine it in a bit more detail. The treatment involves you walking into a room and getting strapped down to the treatment chair. There is another identical room in the same facility, and at the split attosecond of copying you, there is now an identical new you strapped down there in another identical room at the same facility. The new you is a true double sleeve (uploaded or not), and not a p-zombie. Beyond that first moment, your two selves will diverge like ultra perfect twins, similar but distinct, a branching Y shaped identity. Then, over time they will become ever more different until they are indistinguishable. However at the very moment of transference, they are the same you - duplicated. Assuming the copy is perfect, the problem is only one that is philosophical, because this is a futuristic ship of theseus, where the ship is truly duplicated, multiplying like cell division, rather than new pieces occasionally being added. If you kill the original at the same moment that the new one materializes, the continuity would be less than going to sleep, or even crossing a door threshold. 

If you are a closed individualist, then you think of your consciousness a bit like RAM, the disk is only reading while spinning. But in this case the disk keeps spinning, because they multiplied. 

The scenario makes more sense if we view the world in an operational way - you are probably choosing to copy yourself for an important reason. The reason could be to place yourself in a more endurable vessel, run more efficiently on a non biological substrate, in order to live longer, or to speed up and expand your brains computation, or qualia, or simply to better interface with existing technology by increasing your mental bandwidth beyond holding only 5-7 things in your head MAX at one time. Copying could also be done to travel very, very, fast, and far, as when the transporter beams you onto the Enterprise in Star Trek, one of the original settings for imagined continuity problems.

Perhaps this should be viewed as strictly necessary, perhaps we are only dimly aware of the forces which tear us apart every second in our present state, memory disintegration occurs in a dramatic fashion in everyday life, the concept of self must be intensely imagined and shallow, the deluded continuity swallows us all to some degree, whatever measures we take In present time. 

As our knowledge of the brain increases it will stimulate a lot of thought about what it means to be human, because what being human means will change. 

One way to think of the self is to think of the self as the train racing forward over the train tracks of life. 

However a new way of thinking about the self is more like being the rails, and the train is life imprinting itself on yourself at any moment, consciousness are the sparks when they meet. 

Because the world is far more continuous than yourself (not in relation to our culture and other people, other train tracks - a great source of interestingness (to use bostrums' term rather than Yudkowsky's fun, buy when thought of in its totality). 

You can view the self as a stretch of train tracks, the stretch which the train is on at any given moment. If you return to a point of the tracks and the train is no longer on it, this is not you. 
This is a bit like how RAM operates. 

Imagine that the train makes a fat U turn and eventually passes by the tracks it passed before, it might be connected to the tracks of the past, but it is not the same stretch of track, this is the self, a line which extends and never touches the same place twice. 

When you expand your consciousness, with for example memory enhancements, this can be visualized as extending the length of the train, so that it touches more track, in the future we can imagine a train that covers all of the length of track that a human life has today. But when we can do so, we should probably hope that the length of the tracks extend too.
