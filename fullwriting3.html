Open source software, and most software in general, relies on the ability to copy code and run it again elsewhere. When people run the same library on another machine, no one cares that it is not “the original” code, only that it operates in the same way. Why should this not be the same for transferring the human mind and its workings? </p>

The ability to transcribe and move thoughts from medium to medium does nothing to diminish its salience when we read others thoughts, so why not the operation of our own? The transfer of thoughts to more endurable vessels than our brains like stone, bone, parchment, and electronic databases has given veritable superpowers to our species. Why not operate the seat of thought itself on a more endurable, faster, more efficient substrate than the electrochemical machine our headcase currently rests with.
