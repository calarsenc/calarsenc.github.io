---------causal experimentation over correlative understanding-------------

I enjoy talking to and heliping anyone interested in Whole Brain Emulation, and Brain Preservation.  

Let's not spend our precious time fixing what is broken. Let us create and experience something infinitely superior.

I adhere by Crocker's Rules (http://sl4.org/crocker.html#:~:text=Crocker's%20Rules,re%20offended%2C%20it's%20your%20fault) so you can 
prioritize information not politeness
