<h1>CHRISTIAN ALEKSANDER LARSEN</h1>
<p>I am nomadic and spend the majority of my time in the states. I am a technological generalist who runs a consultancy and a capital raising 
firm.

causal experimentation over correlative understanding.

I want to talk to and help anyone interested in Whole Brain Emulation, and Brain Preservation. 

Let's not spend our precious time fixing what is broken. Let us create and experience something infinitely superior.

I adhere by Crocker's Rules (http://sl4.org/crocker.html#:~:text=Crocker's%20Rules,re%20offended%2C%20it's%20your%20fault) so you can 
prioritize information and assume I will absorb it regardless of tone.
