            <h2>Scientific Progress Towards WBE</h2>

            <h3>Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional neuroscience methods that rely on testing correlations between behavior and brain activity cannot reverse engineer a microprocessor (Jonas and Kording 2017), so they are 
unlikely to achieve a true understanding of the much more complex system—the brain.
            </p>

            <blockquote>“What I cannot create, I do not understand.” — Richard Feynman</blockquote>

            <p>
                However, thanks to sustained economic growth, scientific efforts, and exponentially increasing data collection over the last decade, modern neuroscience methods are moving from 
correlational studies to causative explorations.
            </p>

            <h3>Modern Neuroscience Methods</h3>
            <p>Modern neuroscience methods now leverage:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-fidelity datasets created with high-throughput electron microscopy and high-resolution optical expansion microscopy.</li>
                <li>Reconstructions into 3D connectomes using AI-driven interpretation and human proofreading.</li>
                <li>Identification and categorization of an increasing number of cell types, including synaptic receptors and ion channels.</li>
                <li>Calcium and voltage imaging to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits, revealing how neural codes are formed and transformed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These methods are opening new paradigms in neuroscience.</p>

            <h2>NeuroAI</h2>
            <blockquote>“A better understanding of neural computation will reveal fundamental ingredients of intelligence and catalyze the next revolution in AI...” — Zador, Escola, and Richards et 
al. (2023)</blockquote>

            <p>
                Despite the simplicity of current neural network models, we are beginning to see a resemblance between artificial neural networks (ANNs) used in AI and the neural networks of our 
brains. This interplay between neuroscience and machine learning continues to grow, particularly in the burgeoning field of NeuroAI.

            <h3>Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)</h3>
            <p>
                Brain Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are advancing rapidly, particularly in brain recording techniques. Apple has patented fNIRS technology, and projects involving ultrasound whole-brain 
recording are underway. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of various techniques are improving, suggesting future breakthroughs in brain recording.
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>
                In the short term, we may be able to stitch together recordings from multiple organisms to obtain an equivalent amortized organism (Manelut, 2024). This concept is motivating 
exciting progress in neural stitching and brain recording.
            </p>

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                Although Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) is still several decades away, the logical result of continued neuroscience progress is a functional one-to-one model of the brain. If achieved, 
WBE will present both opportunities and risks. We must begin planning for this technology today, as its impact could be profound.
            </p>

            <p>
                Preservation efforts could bridge the gap for those who cannot survive to see this new technological age. Despite skepticism, the dawn of this new age may be closer than we think.
