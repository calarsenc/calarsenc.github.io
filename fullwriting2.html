            <h2>Growing Opportunities in Neuroscience</h2>

            <h3>Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional neuroscience methods that rely on testing correlations between behavior and brain activity cannot reverse engineer a microprocessor (Jonas and Kording 2017), they are therefore unlikely to achieve a true understanding of our much more complex system - the brain. As Feynman's adage goes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” — Richard Feynman
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                However, thanks to the miracle of sustained economic growth and surplus, the heroic scientific efforts of millions, and data collection increasing exponentially over the last decade, we now have modern neuroscience methods of sufficient caliber to move from correlational studies to causative explorations on a grand scale. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Modern Neuroscience methods now leverage:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Chemogenetics, Optogenetics, Photopharmacology, Calcium and voltage imagining to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits showing how neural codes are formed and transformed within the brain. </li>
                <li>High fidelity datasets created with high throughput electron microscopy and high resolution optical expansion microscopy that provide comprehensive anatomical and morphological data.</li>
                <li>Reconstructions into 3D connectomes using AI driven interpretation and human proofreading.</li>
                <li>Identification and categorization of a growing number of cell types, and their components such as synaptic receptors and ion channels.</li>
                <li>Engram labeling technology which is becoming increasingly capable, and experiencing a lot of valuable experimentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It is with methods such as this that we enter a new paradigm in neuroscience.
            </p>

            <h2>Virtual Neuroscience</h2>
            <p>
                Virtual neuroscience that enables causative exploration has several immediate advantages, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Observable</li>
                <li>Reproducible</li>
                <li>Causal ablations, interventions, and edits</li>
                <li>Differentiable</li>
                <li>Less animals involved in research</li>
                <li>Faster (Olah 2021)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>(https://colah.github.io/notes/interp-v-neuro/ details the interpretability of artificial neurons further)</li>

            <h2>NeuroAI</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Is based on the premise that a better understanding of neural computation will reveal fundamental ingredients of intelligence and catalyze the next revolution in AI. This will 
eventually lead to artificial agents with capabilities that match those of humans.” — Zador, Escola and Richards et al. (2023)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
               If you look over at the Neural Networks used in AI, sitting at the bar, spin around 10 times until you are dizzy, take two shots of whisky, spill some whisky in your eyes, and squint hard, they begin to resemble the neural networks used in our brains. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Nonetheless, Neuroscience and Machine Learning have a deeply intertwined history. While we must be cautious not to “look at our feet” and consider whatever advanced technology as a model for the brian:
            </p>
            <blockquote>“(The] wonder of our time, electrical telegraphy, was long ago modeled in the animal machine. But the similarity between the two appara-tus, the nervous system and the electric telegraph, has a much deeper foundation. It is more than similarity; it is a kinship between the two, an agreement not merely of the effects, but also perhaps of the causes.”
(Emil Du Bois-Reymond, On Animal Motion, 1851 F Pasquinelli 2023)
           </blockquote>
           <blockquote>“It has been rightly urged that a history of brain models is really a history of the literary and material technologies which are familiar to, and then used as metaphors by brain scientists. Their metaphorical menagerie exhibits mental clocks, logical pianos, barrel organisms, neural telegraphs and cerebral computer nets. “ (Schaffer 2001 F Pasquinelli 2023)
           </blockquote>

          <h2>There is still very promising things that can be done with AI today that should make us optimistic:</h2>

          <blockquote>“A promising framework is emerging from the interactions between
neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI). [...]
It is the right time to
consider a deep-learning-inspired framework for systems
neuroscience. We have a growing understanding of the key
principles
that underlie ANNs, and
there are theoretical reasons to
believe that
these insights apply generally.”
–Richards et al. (2019), A deep learning framework for neuroscience
</blockquote>

            <p>
The relationship may culminate in further breakthroughs along the line of what von Neumann mentioned in his final public lecture before he left us:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “I suspect that a deeper mathematical study of the nervous system [in fact] may alter the way in which we look on mathematics and logics proper.” — von Neumann
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Space to Improve</h2>
            <p>
                Interplay between the Math, Neuroscience, and ML fields is greatest in the burgeoning field of NeuroAI, and involves foundation models for neuroscience. And we already know that brain decoders can be built by learning the latent structure of neural data through supervised and unsupervised learning to an impressive degree. Neuro models, despite their simplicity and lack of fitted parameters, already effectively predict a wide range of cortical stimulation data (Fine, I., Boynton, G.M, 2024). These models act as 'virtual patients' or 'digital twins,' that are comparable to virtual prototypes in digital manufacturing. Like for any field that moves into digital engineering, such digital prototyping allows rapid and cheap iterative development (most of the things you see right now were created in this manner). This highlights the reasonable nature of being excited about growth in this field, every other engineering field is doing it or already has, BCI and Clinical Neurotech are likely to follow the same footsteps. 
[
This section is inspired by, and the field in general, is being spearheaded by amongst others Patrick Mineault. Who leads the collaborative Neuromatch NeuroAI course: 
https://neuroai.neuromatch.io/tutorials/intro.html Check out his blog: https://www.neuroai.science/p/foundation-models-for-neuroscience. 
Others including Aurelia Song (https://youtu.be/RKcujGTLq2I?si=yowtUUAUybsmJO4_&t=174), The folks over at Stanford working on The Enigma Project (https://enigmaproject.ai/ ) and many others also have very interesting ideas on how to use ML in this field. The Uploaded Intelligence Research Institute uiri.org is describing their efforts in more detail. 

            </p>
            <p>The wider field of brain computer interfaces (BCI) which correlate closely with bottom-up, LoFi non-structural WBE approaches is also making excellent progress. We are able to record more and more of the brain at once:</p>

            <!-- Placeholder image for brain computer interface -->
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1844b50c-8532-4b77-98a8-7f44d9517c74_1564x1204.png" alt="Brain Computer Interface">
                <div class="caption" >(From p.14, Mitelut et al, 2023) https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19223"></div>
                <div class="footnote">Source: https://www.neuroai.science/p/connectomics-behavioural-cloning</div>
            </div>

            <p>
                However, the graph above may not account for the likely breakthroughs we are going to see in brain recording soon (Mineault, 2024), especially due to the median term capital gains it can generate. Apple has patents for fNIRS that would be applied to hundreds of millions of peoples airpods, ultrasound whole brain recording projects already exist https://forestneurotech.org/ , and the signal to noise correlation of diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS)(https://research.facebook.com/publications/high-sensitivity-multispeckle-diffuse-correlation-spectroscopy/) to fNIRS (Zhour et al, 2020)] seems to have a lot of innate potential for improvement. 
            </p>
            <p>
Furthermore, in the short term we might be able to stitch together recordings from multiple organism to obtain one equivalent amortized organism (Safaie, M., Chang, J.C., Park, J. et al. 2023) cited in Mineault, 2024), “a recent study showed that different individuals from the same species learn equivalent latent manifolds to solve motor tasks”(Mineault, 2024)  so alignment may be feasible and is motivating very exciting progress in the field of neural stitching by Mineault and others. 

Likely is the fact that long before we fully understand the brain, we will be applying our technology ever more intimately to help our brains operate, this use should hopefully also aid our understanding significantly. 
            </p>

<h2>The Future:</h2>
                 
Although still several decades away, the logical final result of these neuroscience related efforts is Whole Brain Emulation, a functional one-to-one model of the brain. Unless our rates of progress collapse - we will achieve this goal. 

<blockquote>“For those of a physicalist, functionalist, and patternist persuasion concerning the mind, not only is mind uploading possible, it is inevitable” (Wiley 2023)</blockquote>

The possibilities, and the risks of WBE will then become real. However skeptical such a technology may be perceived today, we must plan for it, and preservation may bridge the gap for those who cannot otherwise stay up to see the sunrise of this new age should it come to pass in the future.
