            <h2>Scientific Progress towards WBE</h2>

            <h3>Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional neuroscience methods that rely on testing correlations between behavior and brain activity cannot reverse engineer a microprocessor (Jonas and Kording 2017), they are 
therefore unlikely to achieve a true understanding of our much more complex system - the brain. As Feynman's adage goes:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “What I cannot create, I do not understand.” — Richard Feynman
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                However, thanks to the miracle of sustained economic growth and surplus, the heroic scientific efforts of millions, and data collection increasing exponentially over the last decade, 
we now have modern neuroscience methods of sufficient caliber that the field is just about able to move from correlational studies to causative explorations. 
            </p>
<!--
            <p>
                Modern Neuroscience methods now leverage:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High fidelity datasets created with high throughput electron microscopy and high resolution optical expansion microscopy that provide comprehensive anatomical and morphological 
data.</li>
                <li>Reconstructions into 3D connectomes using AI driven interpretation and human proofreading.</li>
                <li>Identification and categorization of a growing number of cell types, and their components such as synaptic receptors and ion channels.</li>
                <li>Calcium and voltage imaging to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits showing how neural codes are formed and transformed within the brain.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It is with methods such as this that we enter a new paradigm in neuroscience.
            </p>

            <h2>Virtual Neuroscience: Enabling Causative Exploration</h2>
            <p>
                Virtual neuroscience that enables causative exploration has several immediate advantages, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fully Observable</li>
                <li>Reproducible</li>
                <li>Causal ablations, interventions, and edits</li>
                <li>Differentiable</li>
                <li>Less animals involved in research</li>
                <li>Faster (Olah 2021)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>NeuroAI</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Is based on the premise that a better understanding of neural computation will reveal fundamental ingredients of intelligence and catalyze the next revolution in AI. This will 
eventually lead to artificial agents with capabilities that match those of humans.” — Zador, Escola and Richards et al. (2023)
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                If you look over at the Neural Networks used in AI, sitting at the bar, spin around 10 times until you are dizzy, take two shots of whisky, spill some whisky in your eyes, and squint 
hard, they begin to resemble the neural networks used in our brains. Nonetheless, Neuroscience and Machine Learning have a deeply intertwined history.

like telegraph poles...

            <p>
                The relationship may culminate in further breakthroughs along the line of what von Neumann had as his final request in his final public lecture before he died:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                “I suspect that a deeper mathematical study of the nervous system [in fact] may alter the way in which we look on mathematics and logics proper.” — von Neumann
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)</h3>
            <p>
                The graph above does not account for the likely breakthroughs we are going to see in brain recording soon, especially due to the median term capital gains it can generate. Apple has 
patents for fNIRS that would be applied to hundreds of millions of people's AirPods...

            <p>
                Related to the neural manifolds mentioned above, in the short term we might be able to stitch together recordings from multiple organisms to obtain one equivalent amortized organism 
(Manelut, 2024)...

            <h2>The Future</h2>
            <p>
                The bottom-up WBE approach requires recording the whole brain to have any chance, and this remains constant in terms of personal information theoretic continuation...

            <p>
                Although still several decades away, the logical final result of these neuroscience related efforts is Whole Brain Emulation, a functional one-to-one model of the brain. Unless our 
rates of progress collapse - we will achieve this goal. The possibilities, and the risks of WBE will then become real...
