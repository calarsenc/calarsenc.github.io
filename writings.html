                <h3>EAGX and Strategic Thinking for Whole Brain Emulation</h3>
                <p><em>Written on: August 15, 2023</em></p>
                <p>
                   For EAGX in Berlin earlier this month I gave the following response to the question below:

“””Describe your current plan for improving the world, and (if applicable) why you selected this plan rather than some other close alternative(s).

When I was younger, I was engaged professionally and privately in fundraising efforts that collectively raised approximately ~$100k for various organizations focused on reducing human suffering, in 
my case particularly in areas such as disaster relief, and disability support. Generally I pursued a career with the intention of earning to give for the common good, still unsure what provided the 
highest impact and how to do so best.

As I have grown my knowledge and gained a clearer understanding of the pressing timelines involved, my approach to making a positive impact has now become more systematic, practical and focused in 
the form of a directed plan.

My focus is on computational neuroscience and several related fields, with the aim of contributing towards breakthroughs in our understanding through the several means described below.

This direction is motivated by two key factors: (1) the fertile current state of the field and (2) an understanding of the potential benefits—and the need to mitigate the associated risks—that could 
arise from Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) and its precursors.

1: The Present State of Neuroscience:
Modern neuroscience is now advancing rapidly, utilizing:

- High-fidelity datasets created through high-throughput electron microscopy and high-resolution optical expansion microscopy, which provide comprehensive anatomical and morphological data.
- 3D connectome reconstructions via AI-driven interpretation and human proofreading.
- The identification and categorization of an increasing number of cell types, including their components such as synaptic receptors and ion channels.
- Calcium and voltage imaging techniques to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits, shedding light on how neural codes are formed and transformed within the brain.

These advancements (and many more!) signal a new paradigm in neuroscience, with the field approaching an inflection point that could certainly surpass the significance of the genomics field 
discovery of the DNA double helix. The fact that the field is facing such prospects means that we can scale up research efforts in the field, and that it is ripe for attracting funding. Especially 
efforts that aim for causal experimentation, rather than simple correlative understanding. 

2: The Potential:

Virtual neuroscience enables causative exploration, and offers several immediate advantages, including:

- A reduction in the use of animals in research.
- Full observability and reproducibility of experiments.
- The ability to perform causal ablations, interventions, and edits.
- Faster progress through differentiability.

Furthermore, the ultimate goal of computational neuroscience—whether explicitly acknowledged or not—is Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), which aspires to create a one-to-one model of the human brain, 
potentially paving the way for digital consciousness or "Digital People."

WBE carries significant risks that require much more research, such as the dangers of stable totalitarianism and other forms of suffering. However, it also presents a promising counterbalance to the 
risks posed by artificial intelligence and could ultimately represent the next step in our species-wide evolution toward substrate-independent minds, and all the associated changes this may bring, 
potentially including a universal hedonic > zero.

Regardless of whether challenges like the continuity problem or the binding problem are truly insurmountable, WBE warrants extensive research due to the massive opportunities and risks it presents.

Plans and Actions Taken:

- Learning as much as possible about the state of the field and contributing directly to research (Ongoing).
- Promoting education about the potential of WBE and its precursors to increase interest (Ongoing).
- Serving as an equity broker for funds (and by extension, companies) that are advancing the field (Ongoing).
- Organizing, fundraising, and volunteering for nonprofit organizations that are pushing the field forward (Ongoing).
- Establish a dedicated fund focused on financing WBE research that is capable of attracting significant capital (Planned)

Key Uncertainties and how to resolve them:

The feasibility of WBE is still uncertain, with many many unknowns, such as the degree of scale separation required. Other uncertainties include how technology, particularly WBE, will impact our 
world - how effectively will it and its precursors help counter AI risks and how will it shape our future social fabric.

These uncertainties will be reduced through systems focused research involving the field of computational neuroscience, increasing our understanding of the ethical implications (and advancing our 
collective understanding of personal identity), general futurology, and much more. Let's get to it!!””””””””””


In a recent email chain I wrote the below which is relevant:

“””
Preservation is paramount. I agree that, at this stage, an individual researcher’s impact is magnified 100x by working on preservation versus WBE, current efforts are nothing short of heroic and 
will be remembered in the future.
At present, only a handful of teams are exploring causal mechanisms in neuroscience, with many focusing on correlative approaches. By directing more resources toward diverse causal explorations, I 
believe we can accelerate progress.
Once certain milestones are reached—whether emulating a fly, decoding a non-trivial engram, or something unforeseen—I believe funding for brain preservation will dramatically increase alongside WBE. 
Public understanding should also improve, potentially enabling preservation to become a legal end-of-life option - I think it will be difficult to reach that crucial point without a “Double Helix” 
like milestone for computational neuroscience and WBE.
