            <h1>EAGX and strategic thinking around WBE</h1>
            <p><em>Written for EAGX Berlin, September 2024</em></p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For EAGX in Berlin earlier this month, I gave the following response to the question below:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>“Q1: Describe your current plan for improving the world, and (if applicable) why you selected this plan rather than some other close alternative(s).”</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <p>When I was younger, I was engaged professionally and privately in fundraising efforts that collectively raised approximately ~$100k for various organizations focused on reducing human suffering, in my case particularly in areas such as disaster relief, and humanitarian support. Generally I pursued a career with the intention of earning to give for the common good, still unsure what provided the highest impact and how to do so best. Importance has a heavy-tailed distribution, the most important action may have a value many times the second most important action.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I have grown my knowledge and gained a clearer understanding of the pressing timelines involved, my approach to making a positive impact has now become more systematic, practical, and focused in the form of a direted plan.
            </p>

            <h2>Focus on Computational Neuroscience</h2>
            <p>
                My focus is on computational neuroscience and several related fields, with the aim of contributing towards breakthroughs in our understanding through the several means described below. This direction is motivated by two key factors: (1) the fertile current state of the field and (2) an understanding of the potential benefits—and the need to mitigate the associated risks—that could arise from Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) and its precursors.
            </p>

            <h3>1. The Present State of Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Modern neuroscience is advancing rapidly, utilizing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-fidelity datasets from high-throughput electron microscopy and high-resolution optical expansion microscopy.</li>
                <li>3D connectome reconstructions via AI-driven interpretation and human proofreading.</li>
                <li>Increasing identification and categorization of cell types, including synaptic receptors and ion channels.</li>
                <li>Rapidly Advancing Engram Labelling Technology<li>
                <li>Calcium and voltage imaging techniques to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               These advancements (and many more!) signal a new paradigm in neuroscience, with the field approaching an inflection point that could certainly surpass the significance of the genomics field discovery of the DNA double helix. The fact that the field is facing such prospects means that we can scale up research efforts in the field, and that it is ripe for attracting funding. Especially efforts that aim for causal experimentation, rather than simple correlative understanding.        
     </p>

            <h3>2. The Potential</h3>
            <p>
                Virtual neuroscience enables causative exploration, offering several immediate advantages, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduction in the use of animals in research.</li>
                <li>Full observability and reproducibility of experiments.</li>
                <li>Possibility of performing causal ablations, interventions, and edits.</li>
                <li>Faster progress through differentiability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Furthermore, the ultimate goal of computational neuroscience—whether explicitly acknowledged or not—is Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), which aspires to create a one-to-one model of the human brain, potentially paving the way for digital consciousness or "Digital People". 

WBE carries significant risks that require much more research, such as the dangers of stable totalitarianism and other forms of suffering. However, it also presents a promising counterbalance or mediation to the risks posed by artificial intelligence, and could ultimately represent the next step in our species-wide evolution toward substrate-independent minds, and all the associated changes this may bring, potentially including a universal hedonic > zero. 
            </p>

            <h2>Q2 Plans and Actions Taken</h2>

<li>- Learning as much as possible about the state of the field and contributing directly to research (Ongoing). </li>
<li>- Promoting education about the potential of WBE and its precursors to increase interest (Ongoing). </li>
<li>- Serving as an equity broker for funds (and by extension, companies) that are advancing the field (Ongoing).</li>
<li>- Organizing, fundraising, and volunteering for nonprofit organizations that are pushing the field forward (Ongoing).</li>
<li>- Establish a dedicated fund focused on financing WBE research that is capable of attracting significant capital (Planned).</li>

<h2>Q3 Key Uncertainties and how to resolve them:</h2>
<p>
The feasibility of WBE is still uncertain, with many many unknowns, such as the degree of scale separation required. Other uncertainties include how future technology, particularly WBE, will impact our world - how effectively will it and its precursors help counter AI risks and how will it shape our future social fabric.

These uncertainties will be reduced through serious systems focused research involving the field of computational neuroscience, increasing our understanding of the ethical implications (and advancing our collective understanding of personal identity), general futurology, and much more. Let's get to it!!</p>
            </p>

            <h2>Relevant Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                In a recent email chain, I wrote these strategic thoughts about WBE and Preservation relating to the above:
            </p>

            <blockquote>1: Preservation is paramount. I agree that, at this stage, an individual researcher’s impact is magnified 100x by working on preservation versus WBE, current efforts are nothing short of heroic and will be remembered in the future..
                <br><br>
               2:At present, only a handful of teams are exploring causal mechanisms in neuroscience, with many focusing on correlative approaches. By directing more resources toward diverse causal 
explorations, I believe we can accelerate progress.
                <br><br>
               3: Once certain milestones are reached—whether emulating a fly, decoding a non-trivial engram, or something unforeseen—I believe funding for brain preservation will dramatically 
increase alongside WBE. Public understanding should also improve, potentially enabling preservation to become a legal end-of-life option - I think it will be difficult to reach that crucial point 
without a “Double Helix” like milestone for computational neuroscience and WBE.
