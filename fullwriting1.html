            <h1>EAGX and strategic thinking around WBE</h1>
            <p><em>Written for EAGX Berlin, September 2024</em></p>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                For EAGX in Berlin earlier this month, I gave the following response to the question below:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <strong>“Describe your current plan for improving the world, and (if applicable) why you selected this plan rather than some other close alternative(s).”</strong>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                When I was younger, I was engaged professionally and privately in fundraising efforts that collectively raised approximately ~$100k for various organizations focused on reducing 
human suffering, particularly in areas such as disaster relief and disability support. At that time, I pursued a career with the intention of earning to give for the common good, still unsure what 
provided the highest impact and how to do so best.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I have grown my knowledge and gained a clearer understanding of the pressing timelines involved, my approach to making a positive impact has now become more systematic, practical, 
and focused in the form of a directed plan.
            </p>

            <h2>Focus on Computational Neuroscience</h2>
            <p>
                My focus is on computational neuroscience and several related fields, with the aim of contributing towards breakthroughs in our understanding through the several means described 
below. This direction is motivated by two key factors: (1) the fertile current state of the field and (2) an understanding of the potential benefits—and the need to mitigate the associated 
risks—that could arise from Whole Brain Emulation (WBE) and its precursors.
            </p>

            <h3>1. The Present State of Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Modern neuroscience is advancing rapidly, utilizing:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>High-fidelity datasets from high-throughput electron microscopy and high-resolution optical expansion microscopy.</li>
                <li>3D connectome reconstructions via AI-driven interpretation and human proofreading.</li>
                <li>Increasing identification and categorization of cell types, including synaptic receptors and ion channels.</li>
                <li>Calcium and voltage imaging techniques to analyze functional interactions within neural circuits.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                These advancements are signaling a new paradigm in neuroscience. The field is facing such significant prospects that scaling up research efforts is critical, especially those that 
focus on causal experimentation rather than simple correlative understanding.
            </p>

            <h3>2. The Potential of Virtual Neuroscience</h3>
            <p>
                Virtual neuroscience enables causative exploration, offering several immediate advantages, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduction in the use of animals in research.</li>
                <li>Full observability and reproducibility of experiments.</li>
                <li>Possibility of performing causal ablations, interventions, and edits.</li>
                <li>Faster progress through differentiability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                The ultimate goal of computational neuroscience is Whole Brain Emulation (WBE), which aspires to create a one-to-one model of the human brain, potentially leading to digital 
consciousness or "Digital People."
            </p>

            <p>
                WBE presents both significant opportunities and risks, such as the dangers of stable totalitarianism and other forms of suffering. However, it could also counterbalance the risks 
posed by AI, representing the next step toward substrate-independent minds and the changes this could bring, potentially including a universal hedonic baseline greater than zero.
            </p>

            <h2>Plans and Actions Taken</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning as much as possible about the state of the field and contributing directly to research (Ongoing).</li>
                <li>Promoting education about the potential of WBE and its precursors (Ongoing).</li>
                <li>Serving as an equity broker for funds that are advancing the field (Ongoing).</li>
                <li>Organizing, fundraising, and volunteering for nonprofit organizations advancing WBE research (Ongoing).</li>
                <li>Establishing a dedicated fund for WBE research (Planned).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Uncertainties</h2>
            <p>
                The feasibility of WBE remains uncertain, with many unknowns, such as the degree of scale separation required. These uncertainties will be reduced through systems-focused research in 
computational neuroscience, alongside broader ethical and futurological inquiries. 
            </p>

            <h2>Relevant Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                In a recent email chain, I wrote the following relevant thoughts:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                Preservation is paramount. At this stage, an individual researcher’s impact is magnified 100x by working on preservation versus WBE. Current efforts are nothing short of heroic and 
will be remembered in the future.
                <br><br>
                Only a handful of teams are exploring causal mechanisms in neuroscience, with many focusing on correlative approaches. By directing more resources toward diverse causal explorations, 
I believe we can accelerate progress.
                <br><br>
                Once certain milestones are reached—whether emulating a fly, decoding a non-trivial engram, or something unforeseen—funding for brain preservation will dramatically increase 
alongside WBE, potentially making preservation a legal end-of-life option.
            </blockquote>
