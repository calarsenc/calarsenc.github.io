<h3>Identity</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="paper-entry">
  <h4><strong>Transhumanism and Personal Identity</strong></h4>
  <p>Personal Identity is an important topic that directly influences what individuals work on, in WBE it is a frequent topic of conversation, this essay remains the best summary I know on the state of affairs:</p>
    <p><strong>Hughes, James (2013). “Transhumanism and Personal Identity.” In Max More & Natasha Vita-More (eds.), <em>The Transhumanist Reader: Classical and Contemporary Essays on the Science, Technology, and Philosophy of the Human Future</em> (pp. 227–232). Chichester, West Sussex, UK: Wiley-Blackwell.</strong></p>
    <details>
      <summary><strong>Read the quotes from the Paper!</strong></summary>
<blockquote>
      <blockquote>
    As Thomas Metzinger has documented so brilliantly in his 2009 <em>The Ego Tunnel: The Science of the Mind and the Myth of the Self</em>, neuroscience shows that the “self-y” feeling is simply a useful heuristic that our minds create, without any underlying reality (see also Noe 2009).
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    For Parfit the moral and political upshot of our declining relationship to all future versions of our selves is that we have a corresponding interest in the welfare of all other future persons. At some point, our future selves are likely to be so dissimilar from our current selves that we are better off acting in the interest of all 80-year-olds instead of simply our own.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    Transhumanism has inherited many ideological contradictions from Enlightenment philosophy (Hughes 2010).
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    These include the conflict between atheism and the belief that intelligence could become godlike, or between teleological techno-optimism and the rationalist acknowledgment that the future is uncertain. The conflict between the Lockean and Humean views of the self is another Enlightenment contradiction working away within transhumanism.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    The personal identity conundrum is perhaps more exclusive to transhumanism than the other intra-Enlightenment debates, since it is precisely the prospect of radical neuroscience that has made the erasure of the illusion of personal identity so tangible.
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Bostrum quote cited by Huges:</strong><br>
    “Many philosophers who have studied the problem think that at least under some conditions, an upload of your brain would be you. A widely accepted position is that you survive so long as certain information patterns are conserved, such as your memories, values, attitudes, and emotional dispositions, and so long as there is causal continuity so that earlier stages of yourself help determine later stages of yourself. … These problems are being intensely studied by contemporary analytic philosophers, and although some progress has been made, e.g. in Derek Parfit’s work on personal identity, they have still not been resolved to general satisfaction.”
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Schneider, cited in:</strong><br>
    “In her 2009 essay <em>“Future Minds: Transhumanism, Cognitive Enhancement and the Nature of Persons”</em>, Susan Schneider cites Ray Kurzweil’s 2005 parsing of the personal identity debate into four positions: <br>
    1. The ego theory – a person’s nature is her soul or nonphysical mind, and this mind or soul can survive the death of the body. <br>
    2. The psychological continuity theory – you are essentially your memories and ability to reflect on yourself (Locke) and, more generally, your overall psychological configuration, what Kurzweil referred to as your “pattern.” <br>
    3. Materialism – you are essentially the material that you are made out of – what Kurzweil referred to as “the ordered and chaotic collection of molecules that make up my body and brain.” <br>
    4. The no self view – there is no metaphysical category of person. The “I” is a grammatical fiction (Nietzsche). There are bundles of impressions but no underlying self (Hume). There is no survival because there is no person (Buddha, Parfit).” (Schneider 2009)

<h3>Neural Interaction to Behaviour</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="paper-entry">
  <h4><strong>The time is ripe to reverse engineer an entire nervous system: simulating behavior from neural interactions</strong></h4>
 <p>A great SOTA paper that was recently updated to V5, it promotes reopening the C.Elegans attempt on industrial scale (WORMINATOR) from a strictly academic computational neuroscience perspective. It therefore gives a good overview of where we stand in academia today, naturally there may be shortcuts we do not presently understand.</p>
    <p><strong>Authors:</strong> Konrad P Kording et al.</p>

      <summary>Quotes from the Paper</summary>
<blockquote>
      <p>"When philosophers talk about understanding and explaining, they usually distinguish many kinds thereof. According to Niko Tinbergen (Tinbergen 1963), there are four categories of explanations, divided along the axes of proximate to ultimate and static to dynamic. One goal is to understand the evolutionary trajectory (phylogeny) that made the nervous system the way it is over long timescales. Another goal is to understand how development (ontogeny) gave rise to the individual animal as it is now. A third goal is to understand the function (adaptation) of the nervous system. <strong> And lastly, the goal is to reveal mechanisms (causation)</strong>." 
      </p>
      <p>"This link between neuronal dynamics (both in the form of input-output relations and whole-brain states) and interpretable functions is arguably the holy grail of systems and computational neuroscience (Csete and Doyle 2002)."

<h3>Preservation Overviews:</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="paper-entry">
  <h4><strong>Biostasis: A Roadmap for Research in Preservation and Potential Revival of Humans</strong></h4>
  <p>A great roadmap for research produced in collaboration between cryo and chemofixation advocates. The two industries and viewpoints should try to collaborate as much as possible, but big differences sometimes exist in terms of the personal identity question. This difference is what leads to war in RA by QNTM, let's avoid that. The interests of CRYO and CHEMO today are trivial in terms of practical steps both groups desire like minimising medical legal delay, and improving shared procedures.</p>
